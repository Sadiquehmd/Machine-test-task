# Machine-test-task
machine-test-task for php developer
I have uploaded the whole project in zip format . Kindly extract the zip in one folder.
Steps for installation.
1. Create a database,name it 'student_data' in your local server.
2. Inside the project there is a folder name 'database' which contains database file in sql format which you need to import to the newly created database i.e. 'student_data'.
3. Import 'student_data.sql' into the database 'student_data'.
4. Now run the project on th local server.
#Working of the project
By default the database tables are blank.
By default the login page will open which has the link for register page which will ask you information like "Name, E-mail,Roll Number".
After submitting the regiter form PHP will automatic generate the 8-digit password and displays at the top left corner for just 5-seconds . After 5-second the page will redirect to the login page for log in
